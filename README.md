# shell-encoder
Here's the best encoder/compiler/obsfucator for shell/bash script
By Faizan Quazi  telegram id " t.me/mr_spidder "
These  encoder will work for both pc and Android mobile termux mt-manager

Clone these repository in /sdcard (for pc make a folder in /sdcard)
Copy your original  shell script at location "/sdcard"
And rename that script to  input.sh
Every code written in /sdcard/input.sh will get compiled

Execute compiler.sh with Mt-manager

After execution you will see new file generated named raw.txt in "/sdcard" directory



  
Copy all the containt of that raw.txt file and
Open "template mr_spidder shell compiler.sh" file 
And search for "
You will see bold text 
Select all bold text and past the output of raw.txt
There
Note:DONT REMOVE quote

Save the file and execute

Done. That template file  is now your complete unreadable  shell script
